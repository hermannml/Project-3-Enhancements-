## Purpose and theoretical background
The Power System Simulator is a Python-based tool for modeling and analyzing power systems through a modular, object-oriented design. Users can construct networks using components like buses, transmission lines, transformers, generators, and loads, and simulate system behavior under normal and faulted conditions using per-unit calculations. Core features include automated Ybus/Zbus matrix formation, Newton-Raphson power flow, and symmetrical/asymmetrical fault analysis with full sequence modeling.
To improve interpretability and user engagement, the simulator now includes graphical visualizations of voltage profiles, under the power flow and fault currents using matplotlib and networkx. These plots provide intuitive insights into system performance, line loading, and fault propagation. Designed as both a learning and analysis tool, the simulator reinforces key power system concepts while preparing users for real-world roles in planning, operations, and protection engineering.
One of the main reasons for plotting voltage profiles during power flow analysis is to get a clear picture of how the system behaves as it approaches a steady-state solution. Voltage magnitudes at each bus need to stay within safe operating limits (usually around ±5% of the nominal voltage) to ensure the proper functioning of equipment and the overall reliability of the grid. By tracking how voltage changes at a specific bus over the course of iterative methods like Newton-Raphson, engineers can see whether the system is converging correctly and identify any buses that might be causing issues. This approach is commonly recommended in power system analysis literature, as it helps validate both the numerical solution and the system configuration (Grainger & Stevenson, 1994).
Plotting voltage profiles before and after fault studies is equally important. It allows engineers to observe how a fault—whether it's a three-phase short circuit or an unbalanced line-to-ground fault—impacts the system voltages, particularly at sensitive or critical buses. These voltage dips can indicate how severe the fault is and help in designing better protection schemes. By comparing pre-fault and post-fault voltages visually, one can evaluate the system's ability to withstand and recover from disturbances, a practice grounded in symmetrical component theory and fault analysis methods (Anderson, 1995). This kind of analysis supports decisions related to system reinforcement and is essential for improving system resilience.
